# TODO :
#  - Add clear button: A clear button can be added next to the search
#  button to make it easier for users to clear the search bar if they need to
#  start a new search.
#  - Improve form layout: The search form could be better aligned by moving the
#  "Saisissez un élément que vous souhaitez consulter dans la barre de
#  recherche ci-dessus." text to the top of the search bar.
#  - Add sorting options: Providing sorting options for the search results
#  can be helpful for users to find what they are looking for quickly. For
#  example, users can sort results by name, brand, or type.
#  - Add filtering options: Similar to sorting, filtering options can also make
#  it easier for users to find what they are looking for. Users can filter
#  results by category, brand, or other attributes.
#  - Improve table design: The table design could be improved by making the
#  headers more prominent and using a different background color for alternating
#  rows to make it easier for users to read the results.
#  - Make links more prominent: The link to view more details of a device can
#  be made more prominent by making the icon larger and adding some text to
#  describe what the link does.
#  - Improve responsiveness: The page can be made more responsive to different
#  screen sizes by using a responsive design that adjusts the layout based on
#  the device being used.
#  - Improve accessibility: It is important to ensure that the search page is
#  accessible to users with disabilities. This can be achieved by using proper
#  HTML markup, providing alt text for images, and ensuring that the page can be
#  navigated using a keyboard.
